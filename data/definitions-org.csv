The robustness may be implied and they may not fully realize that extent of needed robustness, but it is mentioned as needs and will add more complexity to the system"

Stocks and cryptocurrencies: Antifragile or robust? A novel antifragility measure of the stock and cryptocurrency markets,"“A system is antifragile when it benefits from noise or disorder.

A managerial operationalization of antifragility and its consequences in supply chains,"“Antifragility refers to systems that gain from volatility and disorder and show an improvement in performance when subjected to large and seemingly implausible changes in parameters. Antifragility encompasses robustness as it means the ability to recover after a shock, however, with the addition to achieve an even higher performance level afterwards.”",2020,"F2, P1A","This def acknowledged that robusness was part of AF, but only received a P1 because it did not include the learning aspect of AF."

2. “Taleb called it antifragile and introduced the concept of antifragility as a property beyond robustness and resilience.” (Russo & Ciancarini, 2017)
3. “According to Taleb (2012), the idea behind antifragility is to survive (even thrive) in the age of complexity and volatility when dealing with unknown randomness and disruptions.” (Taleb, 2012; Russo & Ciancarini, 2017; Hespanhol, 2017)
4. “Antifragility and fragility are degrees on a spectrum, and we can almost always detect antifragility (and fragility) using a simple test of asymmetry: anything that has more upside than downside (convex) from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile. Anything that acts reversely is fragile.” (Russo & Ciancarini, 2017)
5. “While a robust or resilient system resists failure and remains the same or recovers from failure, an antifragile system benefits from shocks, getting better.” (Lichtman et al., 2016; Hespanhol, 2017)",2020,"F2, F1, F3, F5","This def mentions that AF is when as system has more upside than downside, but did not mention learning or consider robustness as part of its definition."
